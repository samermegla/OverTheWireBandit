## Description:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory

## Commands used:
cat ./'--spaces in this filename--'

## Explanation:
Because the shell will interpret spaces as seperators between arguments, I needed to put the entire filename in quotations. The ./ specifies the current directory in which we are searching in.
