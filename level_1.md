## Level description:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Commands used:
ls
cat readme

## Explanation:
I used ls command to list files in the directory. I saw a file named "readme". I then used cat (short for concatenate) readme to reveal the contents of that file which showed me the password for the next level.
